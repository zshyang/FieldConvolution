# Datasets:

## pointnet2.py

Function test_9 could reveal how the distance based sampling working.

And the sampling looks okay.

## pointnet2_model_10.py

The dataset function for ModelNet 10 classification problem.

## pointnet2_yh.py

The dataloader to load the data processed by Yonghui Fan. 

And the figure is generated by running test_9() in the script. 
At this stage, I would say that FPS looks more clean and easier to classify.
