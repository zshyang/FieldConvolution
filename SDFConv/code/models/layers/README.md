The field convolution is 

If the number of input point is equal to the number of output point, 
then no sort or index extraction is needed.

If the number of input point is larger then the number of output points,
then we should probably randomly select the output point index.

Another way is to sample only near the surface. This would actually only
happen in the first layer.
